This repository is my implementation of an android app (Borescope View) that can show the video output of a USB borescope on a smartphone. Images can be saved by pressing a button in the app or the snapshot button on the borescope.
This is not a general use application, it works with my boroscope and can work with others that use the same network protocol. For the description of the protocol, see https://github.com/framenic/freed-borescope

I wrote this application since I don't trust the one provided by the manufacturer, called USB VIEW. Also, I was worried it could be abandoned in the future, rendering the borescope useless.

An apk of the application can be downloaded at https://github.com/framenic/freed-borescope-view/releases/download/v1.0.0/borescope-view.apk 
The project has been built and tested under Android Studio 2024.3.1
