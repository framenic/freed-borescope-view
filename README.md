This repository contains an android app that can show the video output of a USB borescope on a smartphone. Images can be saved by pressing a button in the app or the snapshot button on the borescope.
For the description of the protocol used, see https://github.com/framenic/freed-borescope

I wrote this application since I don't trust the one provided by the manufacturer, called USB VIEW. It requires location permissions and in general there are not guarantees that it will be mantained in the future.
